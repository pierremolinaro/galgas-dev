GALGASGALGAS is a compiler generator written in C++ running under Unix, Win 32, Mac OS Classicand Mac OS X. It is distributed under GPL license. It includes :  - a scanner generator ;  - a parser generator ;  - a static semantics generator ;The parser generator main features are :  - parse LL (1), SLR and LR (1) grammars ;  - automatic syntax error message generation and run-time syntax error recovery ;  - syntax rules can be split into several files ;  - writing rules can use specific select and repeat instructions ;  - handle several parsers in a same application ;The static semantics main features are :  - semantics is defined by a strongly typed attributed grammar computation (ALL(1)    grammar) ;  - grammar attributes include primitive attributes and user-defined lists, classes    and maps ;  - primitive attributes handle a string, character, integer, float, boolean value    and its location in source file ; they are used for locating a semantics error or    warning ;  - lists handle sequences of values ; two iteration instructions are provided : iterate    throught one list, iterate throught two lists (for instance, it can be used for    matching formal argument list with a actual parameter list) ;  - a class can be abstract or not ; single inheritance is provided ; with the    polymorphic assignment, you can built polymorphic trees for handling expressions ;    extract instruction provides the way to get dynamically the actual type of a class     instance, and is combined with automatic semantics error generation in case of    failure ;  - a map includes insert and search methods whose behaviour are defined by a C++    template class ; GALGAS just adds wrapping code for managing user defined associated information and    insert and search errors.The GALGAS scanner, parser and semantics are described in GALGAS sources files.Additional hand-coded C++ files contain C++ code generation.
