Installation notes with CodeWarrior (MAC OS, Windows) :-------------------------------------------------------

	This project needs compiling and linking with LIB PM library.	The Code Warrior project file uses the "Source Trees" feature to define thesource tree "LIB_PM_x_x_x" (where x_x_x denotes needed version) symbol to point
to the actual directory.	For setting this symbol :
	- first open the CodeWarrior project file : an error message is displaying,
saying "LIB_PM_x_x_x" (where x_x_x denotes needed version) symbol is not defined ;
	- then select in "Edit" menu, "Preferences..." item and "Source Trees" panel, andadd the actual directory path with the name "LIB_PM_x_x_x".
