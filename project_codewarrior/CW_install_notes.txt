Installation notes with CodeWarrior (MAC OS, Windows) :-------------------------------------------------------

This project needs compiling and linking with LIB PM library.The Code Warrior project file uses the "Source Trees" feature to define the source tree "LIB_PM" symbol to point to the actual directory.For setting this symbol :
	- first open the CodeWarrior project file : an error message is displaying, saying "LIB_PM" symbol is not defined ;
	- then select in "Edit" menu, "Preferences..." item and "Source Trees" panel, and add the actual directory path with the name "LIB_PM".
